I've put together a basic arm template which takes following key inputs;

- Location - Which location your environment which you wish to deploy the TI indicators to is based in

- Subscription/Tenant/Workspace Information/Location of Workspace - Basic information about your azure environment

- Base Time - Auto applied in code with utcNow()
If you want to control when the lookback works from this value may be worth while editing. I've left it in as a parameter for this reason.

- lookBackPeriod - Defines how long you wish to ingest indicators for as a convenient drop down(All/30 Days/7 Days)
